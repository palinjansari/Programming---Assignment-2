How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

2) It's 0
3) When you insert more or less money than needed you will still get a ticket and it isn't different
5) It's pretty much the same the only difference is the value that I put it to
6) Student{} and LabClass{}
7) Yes it does matter because if you make it class public it doesn't work, it makes the class diagram red and even though it says that it's wrong it doesn't
specifically say what is wrong with the code
8) Yes it is possible
9) It isn't possible
10) Some names in the field include: getPrice(), getBalance(), insertMoney() and printTicket()
11) It's doesn't have a return type and it's a new word
12) int;
    int;
    int;
13) alive
    tutor
    game
14) private Person tutor
    private Student representative;
    private Server host;
    private Game game;
15) The order does matter because writing it as private price int creates an error
16) Yes because without it the code won't work
17) private int status; 
18) 
19) It has 2 parameters
20) Yes it will be. Some of it's fields might be, title and price
21) public Pet(String petsName)
    {
        
    }
22) 
23) In the header it explains their functions and in the body it's a different code to run it
24) It would be "How much money do you have?"
25) No, the return statement doesn't need to be changed
26) 
27) It says "missing return statment"
28) They have a different body
29) Yes, because the machine has a set amount that can't be surpassed
34) int currentAge = 30;
35) private boolean alive; true
37) "My cat has green eyes.
39) It would be # price and cents separated
40) It would all be one word
41) Because you inputed a different amount into the cost
